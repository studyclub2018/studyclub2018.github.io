**Development History**

# Milestone 1:

Milestone 1 started on Nov 5, 2018 and completed Nov 15, 2018.

The goal of our Milestone 1 is to create a landing page for our system and the landing page should help visitor to understand what the site is about. We also want to enable the landing page to link with the user home page, create study session page, edit study session page, admin home page and user profile page. The landing page should be functional and the other five pages could be templates.

_The picture below shows the pages that we created in M1._
