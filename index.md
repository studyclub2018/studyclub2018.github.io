# About StudyClub

StudyClub is a Meteor application for UHM ICS students to self-organize face-to-face study groups around a course and/or specific homework or project topic.


Important design goals for Study Buddy are:

To encourage use of ICSpace among ICS students
To minimize risk of inappropriate encounters by requiring all meetings to occur in ICSpace.
To encourage face-to-face interaction among ICS students.
